```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Importing the Data

```{r}
setwd("~/NYCDSA/ML_project/ML_housing_price_proj")
library(readr)
housing_data_raw <- read_csv("./train.csv")

```


## Determining Missingness

```{r}
# function to calculate percent missingness in each column
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

perc_missingness <- function(x) {
  data.frame("Percent.Missing" = floor(apply(is.na(x), 2, sum)/nrow(x)*100))
}

missing <- perc_missingness(housing_data_raw)
missing$Column.Names <- row.names(missing)
missing <- missing[missing$Percent.Missing > 0, ]

# plotting the missingness

ggplot(missing, aes(x = reorder(Column.Names, Percent.Missing), y = Percent.Missing)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  coord_flip(ylim = c(4,100)) + 
  labs(title = "Percent of Data Missing for each Feature",
       x = "Feature",
       y = "Percent Missing") +
  theme_bw()


```

## Imputing Missingness

```{r}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
